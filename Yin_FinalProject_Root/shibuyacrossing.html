        <p class="shibuyacrossingbodytext"> Put simply, Shibuya Crossing is an intersection. I know what you're thinking - why on earth is that remotely remarkable? Trust me when I say Shibuya Crossing isn't like any other intersection. Hundreds and sometimes thousands of people cross this intersection at once, coming from every direction and swiftly dodging and sidestepping each other with ease. You might think this sounds like a complete nightmare but it's actually a bit of an adrenaline rush. For 45 seconds, you're part of a massive mob of people trying to get from one place to another while flashing lights, giant TV screens, and neon signs look down on you; it's exhilarating. <br>
            <br> It's also fascinating to watch it from above. Grab a seat at on the 2nd floor of the Starbucks in the Tsutaya building and watch the action unfold again and again and again. <br>
            <br>
            <b>How do I get there?</b> Get off at Shibuya Station and take Exit #8, also known as the Hachiko Exit. You can't miss it. <br>

        <p class="snacksbodytext"> Japanese snacks are the best. No, really. As opposed to American snacks which strive to kill you with overdoses of sugar and salt, Japanese snacks allow you to feel a little less guilty for indulging. <br>
            <br> Some of my personal favorites: <br>
            <br> 1) HI-CHEWS<br>
            <br><img src="images/hichew_600px_1_6_1.jpg" alt="Hi-Chews" class="hichews"><br> Think of it as a less sweet, less toothache-inducing version of Starbursts. Except with better flavors. <br>
            <br> 2) ONIGIRI
            <br><img src="images/onigiri-japanese-food-1024x683.jpg" alt="Onigiri" class="onigiri"><br> Rice balls wrapped in seaweed and usually filled with some kind of seafood inner like samon or tuna. <br>
            <br> 3) KIT KATS <br><img src="images/kitkats.jpg" alt="Kit Kats" class="kitkats"><br> I know what you're thinking, "we already have those in the US!" but trust me when I say the Japanese ones are better. The flavor selection alone is a million times better than ours. Blueberry? Sake? Cheesecake? Sign me up. <br>
            <br> All of these snacks can be found in the countless 'konbinis', aka convenience stores, in the area.

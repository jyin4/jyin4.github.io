        <p class="aboutbodytext"> I first fell in love with Tokyo when I studied abroad in Japan in 2007. The neon lights, the eclectic mix of subcultures, the extensive history...I was hooked. Tokyo can seem understandably overwhelming to some but I think that's what I love most about it. It's chaotic in a way that never feels out of control.<br>
            <br> While studying there, I stumbled across a neighborhood called Shibuya and I've been enchanted with it ever since. Some call it the 'Times Square' of Japan but it feels so much more complex than that. There are endless little side streets to explore where every sidewalk is a runway, Shibuya Crossing - a microcosm of Japanese culture in one of the busiest intersections in the world, and snacks on snacks on snacks.<br>

            <br>What's not to love?</p>
